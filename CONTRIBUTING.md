# Contributing Guidelines
If you want to contribute an algorithm for an **existing sequence**, put your program inside the *corresponding folder*. For instance, if you'd like to contribute a `C` program for `near-rep-digit` primes, put it inside the `C` folder. If the language your program is written in doesn't have a folder yet, feel free to create one.

If you want to contribute an algorithm for a **sequence that does not exist yet**, create a folder with the sequence name, conventional names are preferred (view [oeis.org](https://oeis.org/)) and follow the above steps.

Once done putting the program into its corresponding folder, don't forget to update the `README.md` with a short description of your **method**. Add installation guide in `# Usage` section if your program has any dependencies. Don't worry about the `# Speed` section, I'll benchmark the code and update it accordingly.
