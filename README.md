# Funky Primes Generator
This is a collection of curious and kinda cool programs regarding interesting **Prime Sequences**, inspired by [Max Bridgland](https://github.com/M4cs) as he was studying [Glitch Primes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPfAnX5blO0).

# Prime Sequences

* [Near Repeated Digits]()

# Usage
I've used 2 languages for the collection so far. `python` and `C`. The `C` only uses the best method I came up with, whereas the `python` contains all the methods I encountered during the process.

You can write the python scripts normally just by using `python3` or `python` command.
They use standard libraries so not extra requirements.

The C code can either be compiled through `MSVC` or `CLANG`. It currently should be able to generate near rep digit primes upto 100B.

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute your own cool algorithms regarding prime sequences! If the sequence already exists in the collection but you have a different (hopefully more interesting) method, add it to the corresponding language folder. If it doesn't exist yet, make a folder with the sequence name (conventional names are preferred - check [oeis.org](https://oeis.org/)), then add the program to its corresponding language folder.
